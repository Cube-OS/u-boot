/*
 * update_cubeos
 *
 * U-Boot has a DFU utility which currently allows a board to download a new firmware package and
 * distribute the package components to the appropriate end-point locations.
 *
 * We want to leverage the second half of this utility and distribute a new firmware package that's
 * been copied into the upgrade partition, rather than via a USB/TFTP connection.
 *
 * Returns:
 *    0 - An upgrade package was successfully installed
 *   -1 - No upgrade package could be installed and the system should continue normal boot
 *   -2 - No upgrade package could be installed, bu the system should be rebooted so the update can
 *        be attempted again.
